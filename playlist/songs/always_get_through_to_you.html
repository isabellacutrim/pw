    <h1>Letra</h1>
    <p>
    Not here for the riddle<br>
    Maybe just a little<br>
    All eyes on me like i′m blowing a whistle<br>
    The chrome like a pistol<br>
    A tone that could take your thrown if I wish too<br>
    Blown like a tissue<br>
    Yeah I do miss you<br>
    Yeah we could talk but<br>
    Mad that your caught up<br>
    Couldn't interfere with the talk that you bought up<br>
    Balls in the court Like<br>
    Causing a stir like<br>
    Used what you heard but<br>
    Too many words<br>
    Deep down with the termites<br>
    Yeah it burns bright<br>
    Didn′t deter mine<br>
    Stop for the turn signs<br>
    Signs turning<br>
    After 9 if the Lines working<br>
    <br>
    Your worst advice when your mind lurking<br>
    New york new york im skirting<br>
    <br>
    Skkrt<br>
    <br>
    Home used to be with you<br>
    I'm always getting through to you<br>
    Say how I'm feeling<br>
    Your life has been on the move<br>
    Say how i mean it<br>
    If you seen what i seen then you wouldn′t believe it<br>
    I always get through to you<br>
    <br>
    But lately you′ve seemed so blue<br>
    I know that you don't owe me news<br>
    My home used to be with you<br>
    Will I always get through to you?<br>
    <br>
    This is sick mode<br>
    Travellin the brick road<br>
    Wax candles flick the ash from the wick slow<br>
    Ticked low can′t decide what is though<br>
    Never really home but I still made the list though<br>
    <br>
    Bisto dripped like gravy<br>
    Still make the float still get crazy<br>
    Still got my mixed hope<br>
    Stood on my tip toes<br>
    Took on the big role the ice don't phase me<br>
    Face heavy, gaze deadly<br>
    Hella leaks when they siphon petty<br>
    If you feel like the time not ready<br>
    Lets move on past like fresh new grass<br>
    Or brand new senators<br>
    Never could measure us<br>
    Slip of the tongue but the talk is venemous<br>
    Stormed away-out cos they just coudnt just weather us<br>
    Yeah i had a thought But now its not relevant<br>
    <br>
    Like... like now it′s not relevant<br>
    Now it's not relevant<br>
    <br>
    Lately it seems so good<br>
    I know that you don′t owe me news<br>
    My home is to be with you<br>
    Will I Always Get Through To You?<br>
    <br>
