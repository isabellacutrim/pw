    <h1>Letra</h1>
    
    <p>
    I am a little bit of loneliness<br>
A little bit of disregard<br>
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact<br>
That everyone can see these scars<br>
I am what I want you to want<br>
What I want you to feel<br>
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you<br>
To just believe this is real<br>

<br>
So I let go, watchin' you<br>
Turn your back like you always do<br>
Face away and pretend that I'm not<br>
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got<br>

<br>
I can't feel the way I did before<br>
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored<br>
Time won't heal this damage anymore<br>
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored<br>

<br>
I am a little bit insecure<br>
A little unconfident<br>
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can<br>
But sometimes, I don't make sense<br>
I am what you never wanna say<br>
But I've never had a doubt<br>
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you<br>
For once, just to hear me out<br>



<br>
So I let go, watchin' you<br>
Turn your back like you always do<br>
Face away and pretend that I'm not<br>
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got<br>

<br>
I can't feel the way I did before<br>
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored<br>
Time won't heal this damage anymore<br>
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored<br>

<br>
No, hear me out now<br>
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not<br>
Right now, hear me out now<br>
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not<br>
Right now<br>

<br>
I can't feel the way I did before<br>
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored<br>

<br>
I can't feel the way I did before<br>
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored<br>
Time won't heal this damage anymore<br>
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored<br>

<br>
I can't feel<br>
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored<br>
Time won't heal<br>
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored <br>
