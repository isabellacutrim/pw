    <h1>Letra</h1>
   <p>
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me<br>
I think they're okay<br>
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away<br>
They can beg and they can plead<br>
But they can't see the light (That's right)<br>
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right<br>
<br>

'Cause we are living in a material world<br>
And I am a material girl<br>
You know that we are living in a material world<br>
And I am a material girl<br>


Some boys romance, some boys slow dance<br>
That's all right with me<br>
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be<br>
Some boys try and some boys lie<br>
But I don't let them play (No way)<br>
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day<br>
<br>

'Cause we are living in a material world<br>
And I am a material girl<br>
You know that we are living in a material world<br>
And I am a material girl<br>
Living in a material world<br>
And I am a material girl<br>
You know that we are living in a material world<br>
And I am a material girl<br>
<br>

Living in a material world (Material)<br>
Living in a material world<br>
Living in a material world (Material)<br>
Living in a material world<br>

Boys may come and boys may go<br>
And that's all right, you see<br>
Experience has made me rich and now they're after me<br>


'Cause everybody's living in a material world<br>
And I am a material girl<br>
You know that we are living in a material world<br>
And I am a material girl<br>
Living in a material world<br>
And I am a material girl<br>
You know that we are living in a material world<br>
And I am a material girl<br>
<br>

A material, a material, a material, a material world<br>
Living in a material world (Material)<br>
Living in a material world<br>
Living in a material world (Material-al)<br>
Living in a material world<br>
Living in a material world (Material)<br>
Living in a material world<br>
Living in a material world (Material-al)<br>
Living in a material world<br>
<br>
