    <h1>Letra</h1>
<p>
    'Round your city, 'round the clock <br>
Everybody needs you<br>
No, you can't make everybody equal<br>
Although you got beaucoup family<br>
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you<br>
Breathe 'til I evaporated<br>
My whole body see through<br>
Transportation, handmade (G)<br>
And I know it better than most people<br>
I don't trust 'em anyways<br>
You can't break the law with them<br>
Get some gushy, have a calm night<br>
Shooters killin' left and right<br>
Workin' through your worst night<br>
If I get my money right<br>
You know I won't need you<br>
And I tell you (Bitch)<br>
I hope the sack is full up<br>
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up<br>
Spend it when I get that<br>
I ain't tryna keep you<br>
Can't keep up a conversation<br>
Can't nobody reach you<br>
Why your eyes well up?<br>
Did you call me from a séance?<br>
You are from my past life<br>
Hope you're doin' well, bruh<br>
I been out here head first<br>
Always like the head first<br>
Signal comin' in and out<br>
Hope you're doin' well, bruh<br>
Everybody needs you<br>
Everybody needs you<br>
Ooh, nani-nani<br>
This feel like a Quaalude<br>
No sleep in my body<br>
Ain't no bitch in my body, ah<br>
<br>

New beginnings, ahh<br>
New beginnings, wake up, akh<br>
The sun's goin' down<br>
Time to start your day, bruh<br>
Can't keep bein' laid off<br>
Know you need the money if you gon' survive<br>
Every night shit, every day shit<br>
<br>

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift<br>
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit<br>
That kumbaya shit<br>
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet<br>
Wanna feel that na-na though, could you come by?<br>
Fuck with me after my shift<br>
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit<br>
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit<br>
That's every day shit<br>
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation<br>
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation<br>
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit<br>
(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)<br>

All my night, been ready for you all my night<br>
Been waitin' on you all my night<br>
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you're outside<br>
All my night, you been missin' all my night<br>
Still got some good nights memorized<br>
And the look back's gettin' me right<br>
<br>

Every night fucks every day up<br>
Every day patches the night up<br>
On God, you should match it, it's that KO<br>
No white lighters 'til I fuck my twenty-eighth up (Fire)<br>
1998, my family had that Acura (Fire)<br>
Oh, the Legend (Fire)<br>
Kept at least six discs in the changer<br>
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active (Massive)<br>
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions (Massive)<br>
All the reverends<br>
Preachin' self-made millionaire status<br>
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion<br>
After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus<br>
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited<br>
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address<br>
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress<br>
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night<br>
<br>

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah<br>
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit<br>
That kumbaya shit<br>
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet<br>
Wanna feel that na-na though, could you come by?<br>
Fuck with me after my shift<br>
Know them boys wanna see me broke down<br>
See me bummed out, stressed out<br>
That's just every day shit<br>
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation<br>
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation<br>
Every day shit, every day shit<br>
Every night shit, every day shit<br>
Every day shit, every day shit<br>
Every day shit, every night shit<br>
