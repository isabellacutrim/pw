    <p>
<br>
I was like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (Ay, ay, ay)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (Ay, ay, ay, ay)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (Will the real MC please)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (Step to the mic?)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (MC, MC)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (You need a MC)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (Place to be)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (MC, the MC)<br>
<br>

All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar<br>
When I don't even know who you are<br>
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car<br>
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's<br>
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame<br>
And no one here even mentions your name<br>
It must be the weed, it must be the E<br>
'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping<br>
<br>

Ooh whoa oh, oh<br>
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know<br>
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows<br>
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh oh oh<br>
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress<br>
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this<br>
You're delusional, you're delusional<br>
Boy, you're losing your mind<br>
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know<br>
Why you wasting your time?<br>
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex<br>
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex<br>
See upcoming R&B shows<br>
Get tickets for your favorite artists<br>
<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (And all my ladies say)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (And all my girls say)<br>
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o (Obsessed)<br>
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o (Obsessed)<br>
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o (Obsessed)<br>
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o (Obsessed)<br>
<br>

You on your job, you hating hard<br>
Ain't gon' feed you, I'ma let you starve<br>
Grasping for air, I'm ventilation<br>
You out of breath, hope you ain't waiting<br>
Telling the world how much you miss me<br>
But we never were, so why you tripping?<br>
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation<br>
I'm the press conference, you a conversation<br>
<br>

Ooh whoa oh, whoa whoa<br>
Why you so obsessed with me? And boy, I wanna know<br>
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows<br>
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh, oh, oh<br>
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress<br>
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this<br>
You're delusional, you're delusional<br>
Boy, you're losing your mind (Mind)<br>
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?<br>
Why you wasting your time? (Time)<br>
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex<br>
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex<br>

<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (And all my ladies say)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh-ooh -ooh)<br>
So oh, oh, oh, oh (And all my girls say)<br>
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o (Obsessed)<br>
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o (Obsessed)<br>
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o (Obsessed)<br>
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o (Obsessed)<br>

<br>
Ooh whoa oh, whoa whoa<br>
(Hey, he's all up in my George Foreman)<br>
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know<br>
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows<br>
(Lying that you're sexing Mimi)<br>
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh, oh, oh (Eh)<br>
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress<br>
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this (No)<br>
You're delusional, you're delusional<br>
(He's all up in my George Foreman)<br>
Boy, you're losing your mind<br>
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?<br>
(But I can't do nothing for him)<br>
Why you wasting your time?<br>
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex<br>
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex<br>
(You love me, you love me, you really, really love me)<br>
