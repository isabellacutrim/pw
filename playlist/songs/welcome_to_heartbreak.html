   <h1>Letra</h1>
   <br>
   <p>
My friend showed me pictures of his kids<br>
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs<br>
He said his daughter got a brand new report card, card<br>
And all I got was a brand new sports car, oh<br>

<br>
And my head keeps spinning<br>
Can't stop having these visions<br>
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)<br>
And my head keeps spinning<br>
I can't stop having these visions<br>
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)<br>
<br>


Dad cracked a joke, all the kids laughed<br>
But I couldn't hear him all the way in first class<br>
Chased the good life my whole life long<br>
Look back on my life and my life gone<br>
Where did I go wrong?<br>
<br>
And my head keeps spinning<br>
Can't stop having these visions<br>
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)<br>
And my head keeps spinning<br>
I can't stop having these visions<br>
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)<br>
<br>
I've seen it, I've seen it before<br>
I've seen it, I've seen it before<br>
I've seen it, I've seen it before<br>
I've seen it, I've seen it before<br>
<br>
My god-sister getting married by the lake<br>
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take<br>
Bad enough that I showed up late<br>
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake<br>
Welcome to heartbreak<br>
<br>
And my head keeps spinning<br>
Can't stop having these visions<br>
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)<br>
And my head keeps spinning<br>
I can't stop having these visions<br>
I gotta get with it (Ooh, ooh, oooh)

<br>
Ooh-hoo<br>
Ooh-hoo<br>
Ooh-hoo<br>
And I, and I can't stop<br>
No, no, I can't stop<br>
No, no, no, no, I can't stop<br>
No, no, no, no, I can't stop<br>
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop<br>
No, no, no, no<br>
No, no, no, no<br>
No, no, no, no<br>
No, no, I can't stop<br>
No, can't stop having these visions<br>
I gotta get with it<br>
Ooh, ooh, oooh<br>
Hoo-hoo, ho-ho-hoo<br>
Ooh-hoo<br>
